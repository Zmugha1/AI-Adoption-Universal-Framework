# Protection Architecture — Corrected Reference

Use this as the source of truth when building slides or diagrams.

## Column 1: AI Training Consultant (You)

### What You Do
- Assess M1-M4 maturity
- Architect zone structure
- Facilitate champion workshops
- Configure MCP server
- Train champions (teach the teachers)
- Build entropy dashboards
- EXIT at M3/M4

### What You DON'T Do
- ❌ Write production code
- ❌ Make architectural decisions
- ❌ Stay forever

### Protecting Human Coding Architecture
- **Threat:** AI generates inconsistent patterns
- **Solution:** Consultant maps sacred architecture → MCP enforces patterns → Champion defines 'our way'
- **Result:** Architecture persists despite AI automation
- **Quote:** *"I build the system that protects your experts, then I leave."*

---

## Column 2: MCP Server (It)

### What It Does
- Guards Red Zone files (blocks unauthorized edits)
- Scaffolds based on skill (Novice=verbose, Expert=terse)
- Counts entropy metrics automatically
- Reminds of VTCO constraints
- Blocks commits violating rules

### What It CANNOT Do (Reality)
- ❌ Know business priority
- ❌ Write tribal knowledge
- ❌ Judge promotion readiness
- ❌ Build trust with humans
- ❌ Override emergencies

### Protecting Tribal Knowledge
- **Threat:** Experts leave, knowledge evaporates
- **Solution:** Consultant extracts via workshop → MCP surfaces at moment of need → Champion updates
- **Result:** Knowledge lives in repo, not heads
- **Quote:** *"Not a data center. One Python file. The 'server' just means it responds to Cursor/Copilot requests."*

---

## Column 3: Champion (They)

### What They Own
- Red Zone Decisions (veto power)
- Tribal Knowledge (VTCO docs)
- Skill Assessment (Novice vs Expert)
- Mentoring (human coaching)
- Governance Override (emergency judgment)
- Pattern Definition ("our way")

### What They DON'T Do
- ❌ Manual enforcement (MCP blocks automatically)
- ❌ 20-page docs (VTCO is structured YAML)
- ❌ Review boilerplate (Green Zone is automated)

### Protecting Champion Expert Judgment
- **Threat:** Champions burned out, become bottlenecks
- **Solution:** Consultant gives authority + time protection → MCP filters noise → Champion decides only judgment calls
- **Result:** Champions enable scale; AI handles toil
- **Quote:** *"The most expensive expertise. Amplified, not replaced. Protected from becoming a bottleneck."*

| Consultant quote | "Protecting Human Coding Architecture, then I leave." | "I build the system that protects your experts, then I leave." |
| MCP quote | "The 'server' just shuts down if I stop doing architecture." | "The 'server' just means it responds to Cursor/Copilot requests." |
| Tribal Knowledge solution | "Consultant extracts tribal workshops" | "Consultant extracts via workshop" |
| Champion quote | "Amplified, not throttled" | "Amplified, not replaced" |
| Champion "What They DON'T Do" | "? Champion Protection" (wrong place) | Remove—Champion Protection is a section title, not something they don't do |
