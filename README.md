# Universal AI Governance Framework

A consulting methodology for AI adoption that protects human expertise while enabling scale.

## The Three Roles Architecture

🎯 **AI Training Consultant** (You)
- Assesses, architects, configures, trains, exits
- Brings methodology + MCP setup + change management
- 8-week engagement, then quarterly check-ins

🤖 **MCP Server** (Technical Enforcer)
- Local Python script (not cloud infrastructure)
- Blocks Red Zone edits, scaffolds by skill, logs entropy
- Cannot judge business priority or build human trust

👑 **Champion** (Human Expert)
- Owns Red Zone decisions, authors tribal knowledge (VTCO)
- Assesses skills, mentors transitions, governs emergencies
- Protected from burnout by automation

## Maturity Progression

M1 (Gray) → M2 (Orange) → M3 (Blue) → M4 (Gold)

- M1: Chaos (no governance)
- M2: Shallow (licenses, no governance) ← **Baseline**
- M3: Agentic (governed autonomy) ← **Target**
- M4: Autonomous (self-optimizing)

## Protection Architecture

1. **Human Coding Architecture**: MCP enforces patterns champion defines
2. **Tribal Knowledge**: VTCO format captures expertise in repo
3. **Champion Judgment**: Authority formalized, noise filtered by MCP

## Evidence-Based

- Entropy Formula: (Bloat×0.25) + (Rework×0.25) + (Reverts×0.20) + (Premature×0.30)
- Git-based metrics: Non-gameable, objective
- Week-by-week improvement: Measurable, guaranteed

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
